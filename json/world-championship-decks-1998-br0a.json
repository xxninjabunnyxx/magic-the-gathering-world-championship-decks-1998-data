He placed second at Pro Tour™—Los Angeles and finished in the Top 16 at Grand Prix—San Francisco, his hometown. Ben played the archetypal mono-red weenie or Sligh deck at the 1998 Worlds. Although he prefers to play a more balanced deck, Rubin thought the aggressive Sligh would work well at this tournament. His deck consists of roughly one-third land, one-third direct damage, and one-third small aggressive creatures.","colors":[],"color_identity":[],"keywords":[],"legalities":{"standard":"not_legal","future":"not_legal","historic":"not_legal","gladiator":"not_legal","pioneer":"not_legal","explorer":"not_legal","modern":"not_legal","legacy":"not_legal","pauper":"not_legal","vintage":"not_legal","penny":"not_legal","commander":"not_legal","oathbreaker":"not_legal","brawl":"not_legal","historicbrawl":"not_legal","alchemy":"not_legal","paupercommander":"not_legal","duel":"not_legal","oldschool":"not_legal","premodern":"not_legal","predh":"not_legal"},"games":["paper"],"reserved":false,"foil":false,"nonfoil":true,"finishes":["nonfoil"],"oversized":false,"promo":false,"reprint":false,"variation":false,"set_id":"e8732c3a-160c-41da-bc79-5da86431b17d","set":"wc98","set_name":"World Championship Decks 1998","set_type":"memorabilia","set_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/sets/e8732c3a-160c-41da-bc79-5da86431b17d","set_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=set&q=e%3Awc98&unique=prints","scryfall_set_uri":"https://scryfall.com/sets/wc98?utm_source=api","rulings_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/06e4ce71-a557-4a05-a163-9f28b8f6479b/rulings","prints_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=released&q=oracleid%3A5f03c43b-292f-42b5-915c-43bb4429ed6f&unique=prints","collector_number":"br0a","digital":false,"rarity":"common","card_back_id":"df9a3149-dae5-4319-85bb-00d37c023360","artist":"","border_color":"gold","frame":"1997","full_art":false,"textless":false,"booster":false,"story_spotlight":false,"prices":{"usd":null,"usd_foil":null,"usd_etched":null,"eur":null,"eur_foil":null,"tix":null},"related_uris":{"tcgplayer_infinite_articles":"https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/search?contentMode=article&game=magic&partner=scryfall&q=Ben+Rubin+Bio&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","tcgplayer_infinite_decks":"https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/search?contentMode=deck&game=magic&partner=scryfall&q=Ben+Rubin+Bio&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","edhrec":"https://edhrec.com/route/?cc=Ben+Rubin+Bio"},"purchase_uris":{"tcgplayer":"https://www.tcgplayer.com/search/magic/product?productLineName=magic&q=Ben+Rubin+Bio&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall&view=grid","cardmarket":"https://www.cardmarket.com/en/Magic/Products/Search?referrer=scryfall&searchString=Ben+Rubin+Bio&utm_campaign=card_prices&utm_medium=text&utm_source=scryfall","cardhoarder":"https://www.cardhoarder.com/cards?affiliate_id=scryfall&data%5Bsearch%5D=Ben+Rubin+Bio&ref=card-profile&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=card&utm_source=scryfall"}}
