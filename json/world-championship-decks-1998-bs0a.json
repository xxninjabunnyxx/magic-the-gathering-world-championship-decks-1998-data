The former is used to put creatures into the graveyard and the latter can then bring them into play. With this combo, Selden is able to use his creatures to react to an opponent's threats. The deck also contains over twenty creatures, many of which have an effect when they enter play or perform some other useful function, such as the Spike Weaver. Unlike many similar decks, Selden's dips into blue, primarily for Lobotomy. He said this was the key to many of his victories.","colors":[],"color_identity":[],"keywords":[],"legalities":{"standard":"not_legal","future":"not_legal","historic":"not_legal","gladiator":"not_legal","pioneer":"not_legal","explorer":"not_legal","modern":"not_legal","legacy":"not_legal","pauper":"not_legal","vintage":"not_legal","penny":"not_legal","commander":"not_legal","oathbreaker":"not_legal","brawl":"not_legal","historicbrawl":"not_legal","alchemy":"not_legal","paupercommander":"not_legal","duel":"not_legal","oldschool":"not_legal","premodern":"not_legal","predh":"not_legal"},"games":["paper"],"reserved":false,"foil":false,"nonfoil":true,"finishes":["nonfoil"],"oversized":false,"promo":false,"reprint":false,"variation":false,"set_id":"e8732c3a-160c-41da-bc79-5da86431b17d","set":"wc98","set_name":"World Championship Decks 1998","set_type":"memorabilia","set_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/sets/e8732c3a-160c-41da-bc79-5da86431b17d","set_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=set&q=e%3Awc98&unique=prints","scryfall_set_uri":"https://scryfall.com/sets/wc98?utm_source=api","rulings_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/cdbe9dfc-3c91-40ac-9740-167e17746e94/rulings","prints_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=released&q=oracleid%3A63979b7e-cfe2-4feb-a767-764269fc0d90&unique=prints","collector_number":"bs0a","digital":false,"rarity":"common","card_back_id":"df9a3149-dae5-4319-85bb-00d37c023360","artist":"","border_color":"gold","frame":"1997","full_art":false,"textless":false,"booster":false,"story_spotlight":false,"prices":{"usd":null,"usd_foil":null,"usd_etched":null,"eur":null,"eur_foil":null,"tix":null},"related_uris":{"tcgplayer_infinite_articles":"https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/search?contentMode=article&game=magic&partner=scryfall&q=Brian+Selden+Bio&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","tcgplayer_infinite_decks":"https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/search?contentMode=deck&game=magic&partner=scryfall&q=Brian+Selden+Bio&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","edhrec":"https://edhrec.com/route/?cc=Brian+Selden+Bio"},"purchase_uris":{"tcgplayer":"https://www.tcgplayer.com/search/magic/product?productLineName=magic&q=Brian+Selden+Bio&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall&view=grid","cardmarket":"https://www.cardmarket.com/en/Magic/Products/Search?referrer=scryfall&searchString=Brian+Selden+Bio&utm_campaign=card_prices&utm_medium=text&utm_source=scryfall","cardhoarder":"https://www.cardhoarder.com/cards?affiliate_id=scryfall&data%5Bsearch%5D=Brian+Selden+Bio&ref=card-profile&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=card&utm_source=scryfall"}}
