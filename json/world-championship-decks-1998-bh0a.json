Hacker said his deck was well set up to defeat his opponents with its twenty-something aggressive creatures—including a number of shadow and en-Kor creatures. Unlike traditional white weenie decks, which rely on Armageddon as a major threat card, Hacker's deck uses Cataclysm, which he feels better complements the use of Empyrial Armor.","colors":[],"color_identity":[],"keywords":[],"legalities":{"standard":"not_legal","future":"not_legal","historic":"not_legal","gladiator":"not_legal","pioneer":"not_legal","explorer":"not_legal","modern":"not_legal","legacy":"not_legal","pauper":"not_legal","vintage":"not_legal","penny":"not_legal","commander":"not_legal","oathbreaker":"not_legal","brawl":"not_legal","historicbrawl":"not_legal","alchemy":"not_legal","paupercommander":"not_legal","duel":"not_legal","oldschool":"not_legal","premodern":"not_legal","predh":"not_legal"},"games":["paper"],"reserved":false,"foil":false,"nonfoil":true,"finishes":["nonfoil"],"oversized":false,"promo":false,"reprint":false,"variation":false,"set_id":"e8732c3a-160c-41da-bc79-5da86431b17d","set":"wc98","set_name":"World Championship Decks 1998","set_type":"memorabilia","set_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/sets/e8732c3a-160c-41da-bc79-5da86431b17d","set_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=set&q=e%3Awc98&unique=prints","scryfall_set_uri":"https://scryfall.com/sets/wc98?utm_source=api","rulings_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/a8d38af0-a960-4a49-9896-1e11f53eab5b/rulings","prints_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=released&q=oracleid%3Aba589dd4-eccd-42b2-badf-f9f30a0c399d&unique=prints","collector_number":"bh0a","digital":false,"rarity":"common","card_back_id":"df9a3149-dae5-4319-85bb-00d37c023360","artist":"","border_color":"gold","frame":"1997","full_art":false,"textless":false,"booster":false,"story_spotlight":false,"prices":{"usd":null,"usd_foil":null,"usd_etched":null,"eur":null,"eur_foil":null,"tix":null},"related_uris":{"tcgplayer_infinite_articles":"https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/search?contentMode=article&game=magic&partner=scryfall&q=Brian+Hacker+Bio&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","tcgplayer_infinite_decks":"https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/search?contentMode=deck&game=magic&partner=scryfall&q=Brian+Hacker+Bio&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","edhrec":"https://edhrec.com/route/?cc=Brian+Hacker+Bio"},"purchase_uris":{"tcgplayer":"https://www.tcgplayer.com/search/magic/product?productLineName=magic&q=Brian+Hacker+Bio&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall&view=grid","cardmarket":"https://www.cardmarket.com/en/Magic/Products/Search?referrer=scryfall&searchString=Brian+Hacker+Bio&utm_campaign=card_prices&utm_medium=text&utm_source=scryfall","cardhoarder":"https://www.cardhoarder.com/cards?affiliate_id=scryfall&data%5Bsearch%5D=Brian+Hacker+Bio&ref=card-profile&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=card&utm_source=scryfall"}}
